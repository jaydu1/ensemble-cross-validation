# Ensemble-cross-validation


`sklearn_ensemble_cv` is a Python module for performing accurate and efficient ensemble cross-validation methods from various [projects](https://jaydu1.github.io/overparameterized-ensembling/).


## Features
- The module builds on `scikit-learn`/`sklearn` to provide most flexibity on various base predictors.
- The module includes functions for creating ensembles of models, training the ensembles using cross-validation, and making predictions with the ensembles. 
- The module also includes utilities for evaluating the performance of the ensembles and the individual models that make up the ensembles.


```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn_ensemble_cv import ECV

# Hyperparameters for the base regressor
grid_regr = {    
    'max_depth':np.array([6,7], dtype=int), 
    }
# Hyperparameters for the ensemble
grid_ensemble = {
    'max_features':np.array([0.9,1.]),
    'max_samples':np.array([0.6,0.7]),
}

res_ecv, info_ecv = ECV(
    X_train, y_train, DecisionTreeRegressor, grid_regr, grid_ensemble, 
    M=50, M_max=100, return_df=True
)
```


# Cross-validation methods

This project is currently in development. More CV methods will be added shortly.

- [x] split CV
- [x] K-fold CV
- [x] ECV
- [x] GCV
- [x] CGCV


# Usage

Check out Jupyter notebook [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/jaydu1/ensemble-cross-validation/blob/main/demo.ipynb) about how to apply ECV on risk estimation and hyperparameter tuning for ensemble learning.
